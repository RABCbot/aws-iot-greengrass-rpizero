Create lambda in AWS Console and deploy to your Greengrass core<br/>
You will also need two AWS IoT Greengrass subscriptions: From Lambda to IoT Core on topic home/services/status and from IoT core to Lambda on topic home/services/trigger<br/>
Note: In my case, I had to manually copy this file together with the greengrasssdk folder to the Rpi Zero folder greengrass/ggc/core/runtime/python folder
